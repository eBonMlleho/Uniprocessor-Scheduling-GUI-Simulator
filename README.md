# Uniprocessor-Scheduling-GUI-Simulator
A Simple Uniprocessor Scheduling GUI Simulator for RMS and EDF

## Course Introduction
In this project, a GUI Simulator for RMS and EDF algorithm in a simple uniprocessor scheduling is developed by Java in Eclipse IDE.

The main program takes task sets and parameters from user input, and then does scheduling analysis, constructs scheduler in the form of a graph, and provides text feedback for uniprocessor scheduling.

The evaluation and test include all possible scenarios for RMS and EDF such as text feedback when utilization test fails, GUI display when utilization test passed, and user input task set numbers.
